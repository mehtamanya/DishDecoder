# DishDecoder Project

This project involves building a React-based web application for scanning QR codes, calculating food dish calorie counts, and managing inventory. It uses Node.js and MongoDB for the backend to handle the data and QR code processing.

## Features

- Scan food dish QR codes and get calorie information.
- Manage inventory data using MongoDB.
- Display calorie information and other dish details on the frontend.
- Fetch data from the backend to display on the user interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Others**: QR Code scanning, RESTful APIs

## Installation
